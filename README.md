## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JSON

### What I learned

I used the provided JSON file to dynamically render the chart, scaling each bar and displaying its daily amount. Additionally, I applied the Date object to detect and highlight the current day’s bar with a distinct color.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to continue to work with JSON files to update elements on the page.

### Useful resources

- [Working with data](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/javascript-fundamentals-oR7g6-mTZ-/steps/686ef467449a25f45b62154d/article/read) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand JSON. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
